From the OpenAPI Specification:\nThe OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, programming language-agnostic interface document for HTTP APIs, which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of a service without requiring access to source code, additional documentation, or inspection of network traffic. When properly defined via OpenAPI, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Similar to what interface documentation have done for lower-level programming, the OpenAPI Specification removes guesswork in calling a service.\nProject Status This project is currently in BETA. We expect the spec to be accurate, but it is currently in active development and unsupported. If you\u0026rsquo;ve identified a mismatch between Twilio\u0026rsquo;s API behavior and this specification, please open an issue.\nContributing Because this document is used across Twilio\u0026rsquo;s whole API development experience, these documents are automatically kept up to date and used to validate Twilio API requests.\n"},{"id":7,"href":"/twilio-apis/api/accounts/addresses/","title":"Addresses","parent":"Accounts","content":"Create and manage addresses.\nLIST Show all addresses.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; FETCH Fetch an Address.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; PHONE NUMBERS List Dependent Phone Number Subresources.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; CREATE Create an Address.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; UPDATE Update a customer name and street address.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; DELETE Delete an Address.\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; "},{"id":8,"href":"/twilio-apis/api/lookup/lookup-v2/","title":"Lookup v2","parent":"Lookup","content":"The Lookup v2 API provides a way to retrieve additional information about a phone number.\nNUMBER Performs basic phone number validation and conversion from regional formatting to E.164 (free).\nGET POST PUT PATCH DELETE Send Params Auth Headers Path Params Query Params \u0026plus; JSON Body \u0026plus; Request Response Status: \u0026#9998; \u0026#10005; LINE TYPE Provides carrier info and type (mobile, landline or voip).
